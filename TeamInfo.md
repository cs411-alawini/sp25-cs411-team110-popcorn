## Project Summary

This project aims to create an AI-powered job recommendation and notification system that automates the job search process for users. By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing, the system will help create resumes and analyze user resumes, extract relevant skills, and match them with job descriptions from various sources.  

The platform will provide personalized job recommendations based on resume content, ensuring that users receive opportunities tailored to their qualifications and interests. It will also automate job notifications, sending alerts via email whenever a suitable job is found.  

In addition to automated recommendations, the system will offer search and filtering options, allowing users to manually explore job postings based on keywords, location, and salary range. 

To source job postings, the system will integrate public job APIs and curated datasets, ensuring real-time access to relevant job opportunities. By eliminating the need for constant job board monitoring, the platform will streamline the job-seeking process, saving users time and effort.
